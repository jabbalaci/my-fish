# My Fish

This repo. contains my configuration files for
the [Fish shell](https://fishshell.com/).

Location of this folder: `~/.config/fish`

## Filters

I've made lots of useful filters that you can
find in the `functions/` folder.

A filter takes the output of a program and transforms
it. It is used after a pipe. Example:

```shell
$ echo "hello" | upper
HELLO
```

I plan to list all my filters here with examples.

## Issues

If you have an idea how to improve something, or
if you find a bug, feel free to issue a ticket.
